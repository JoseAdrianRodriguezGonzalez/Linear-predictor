# As first step:

1. Check the dataset as it is.
2. Look for papers or articles that could help to give a look out into the problem
3. Start the LaTeX file.

This is the workflow that it is required to look and therefore, always at each point, write it down on your slide to be shown at the day.

First, attack the first csv that must be the easier one with the next procedure.
1. check the headers
2. Check the basci parameters on statistics as mean, median,frequency, max or min
3. Recommendably check out a plot 
4. Analyze the categorical data.
5. Look out if there are data that is useless
6. It may have seen some outliers, check how to deal with them
7. Look for loss data and NaNs, format the data
8. Normalize the data, reduce dimensionality
9. Check the correaltions
10. choose your model
11. train the model and evaluate it
